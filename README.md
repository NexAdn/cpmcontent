# CPMcontent
CPMcontent is a testing repository for my ComputerCraft Lua script called "CPM" (ComputerCraft Package Mangager) which will work similarly to the known Linux package manager (e.g. APT, RPM).
CPM itself is currently work in progress and not ready yet.

When CPM is published, I will offer the creation of own packages to be added in this repository.
